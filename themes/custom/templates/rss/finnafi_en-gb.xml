       <title>Harbour lights and shadows found in Kotka</title>
      <description>Kotka Harbour came into being to meet the needs of the sawmill industry in the 1870s. Over the years, the harbour has grown, manpower was taken over by machinery and simple general cargo has turned into massive shipping containers. Kotka has always been one of the most important ports of export in Finland and a gateway of the forest industry to the world.</description>
