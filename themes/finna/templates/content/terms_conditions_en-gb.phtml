    <h2>Handling customer data in Finna</h2>

     <p>When a user logs in to Finna with his or her library card, the service stores the number and PIN code of the card as well as the user’s first and last names, email address and home library. When logging in using Haka, Finna automatically stores the username, name and email of the user. When logging in with Finna ID the username, name and email address of the user are stored in Finna. The information is used for the following purposes:</p>

     <table class="content-table">
         <tr>
             <td><strong>Information</strong></td>
             <td><strong>Purpose</strong></td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
             <th>Library card number</th>
             <td>User authentication</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
             <th>Username</th>
             <td>User authentication</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
             <th>PIN-code</th>
             <td>User authentication for service interfaces</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
             <th>First name</th>
             <td>User authentication and display of information</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
             <th>Last name</th>
             <td>User authentication and display of information</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
             <th>Email</th>
             <td>Default address for email, can be edited by the user in Finna</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
             <th>Home Library</th>
             <td>Default collection point for reservations, can be edited by the user in Finna</td>
         </tr>
     </table>

     <p> The email address stored in Finna is used only to send emails requested by the user, such as due date reminders
         and new entries alerts.
     </p>

     <p> In addition to the above information, Finna may store information about the user’s Finna activities. Such information
         includes the language of use, the receiving of due date reminders and new entries alerts, records saved in the user’s lists,
         library cards added by the user, and social metadata (comments, reviews, keywords).
     </p>

     <p> Other features that require the handling of user information (e.g., browsing borrowed and reserved material, as well as fees,
         making reservations, renewing loans) use the service interfaces of the library system, and this information is not stored in
         Finna with the exception of the optional due date reminders. When a due date reminder is sent, the ID number and due date of
         the borrowed item is stored to ensure that the reminder is sent only once.</p>

     <p> Finna accounts created using a library card or Finna ID or Haka username are separate from each other even if they
         have the same numerical identifier.
